This is a C++ library for Numerical Computation and Signal Processing. All of the algorithms is implemented by C++ template classes, and organized by ".h" files, so you don't need compile them by yourself.



The SP++ is also published at "Open Source China", the blog publishing URL is: http://my.oschina.net/zmjerry/blog.
